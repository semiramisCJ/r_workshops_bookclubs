Why does this code succeed without errors or warnings?
```{r}
x <- numeric()
out <- vector("list", length(x))
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  out[i] <- x[i] ^ 2
}
out
```


When the following code is evaluated, what can you say about the vector being iterated?
```{r}
xs <- c(1, 2, 3)
for (x in xs) {
  xs <- c(xs, x * 2)
}
xs
```

What does the following code tell you about when the index is updated?
```{r}
for (i in 1:3) {
  i <- i * 2
  print(i) 
}
```
