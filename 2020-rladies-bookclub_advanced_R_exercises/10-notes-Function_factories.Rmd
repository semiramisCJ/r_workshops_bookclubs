```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(rlang)
```

```{r}
power1 <- function(exp) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}
x<-2
square <- power1(x)
cube <- power1(3)
```

Here, "When square() executes x ^ exp it finds x in the execution environment and exp in its enclosing environment."
```{r}
square(10)
```
