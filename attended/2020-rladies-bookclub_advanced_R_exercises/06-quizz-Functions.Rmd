What are the three components of a function?
Body, arguments and ENVIRONMENT

What does the following code return?
```{r}
x <- 10
f1 <- function(x) {
  function() {
    x + 10
  }
}
f1(1)()
```
11

How would you usually write this code?

```{r}
`+`(1, `*`(2, 3))
```

```{r}
#Like this?
1 + 2*3
```


How could you make this call easier to read?
```{r}
#mean(, TRUE, x = c(1:10, NA))
```

```{r}
#Maybe with
x=c(1:10, NA)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```



Does the following code throw an error when executed? Why or why not?
```{r}
f2 <- function(a, b) {
  a * 10
}
f2(10, stop("This is an error!"))

```
A: No, because b is never evaluated

Whatâ€™s a replacement function? How do you write it?
